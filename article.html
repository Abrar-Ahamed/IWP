        <h2><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h2><br>
        
        My name is Abrar and I hail from Ramnathapuram district of Tamil Nadu. 
        Currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science at VIT Chennai. My father is an engineer and 
        my mother is a housewife. I have one elder brother who studies in class Ninth. My brother and I went to the same school. 
        He is 6 years elder than me, so i get to learn a lot from his experience. He finished his B.Tech Mechanical engineering
        at NIT Warangal. Later on, like any other engineer other than CS engineer would do switched to IT as 
        jobs were not available much in that domain. Always relied on him for his ideas and learnings
         in this domin. Being a CSE student is not a piece of cake. There is a lot of competition out here 
        and overall around the world. I always had a knack for story writing and also a good singer.
        After I finished my 12th grade, I dint have the courage to speak up or to even take the risk personally
        to venture a different domain. I picked up engineering and especially CSE cause I was told that it is easier
        compared to other engineering departments and also the pay was high after graduation. But after all seems like
        getting a high pay was not as easy as I imagined. Always relied on him for his ideas and learnings

        <h2><b>SCHOOL</b></h2><br>
          
        Studied in India International School CBSE. Loved my school life. Those were days when life was like
        a fantasy, when everyone seemed friendly and caring, no drama. The morning assembly used to be the best feel ever,
        the usual routine of starting with the morning prayer followed by thought for the day and then occassionally a skit
        performed by the students, always wished the skit was longer so that the first period would shorten. During lunch break, the 
        curiosity of what mom kept for lunch and the moment you realize its your favourite makes your day. As soon as you return home
        watching TV while having lunch and then a long nap after lunch, the relaxation and the thought of not having to do anything
        just feels so peaceful. Waking up around 5pm, having a cup of milk along with a snack and then going to play in the park
        for a while, coming home all pumped up and then doing homeworks and stuff for an hour at most. Finally have dinner, a chat with dad
        on somedays and then to sleep. It was all like a dream until you enter the mid teenage life.

        <h2><b>MY PROJECTS</b></h2>
        <h3><b>STOCK MARKET PORTFOLIO GENERATOR</b></h3>
        Developed a user-friendly
            web page using python and deployed using heroku. The purpose of the application is to generate a 
            stock portfolio for a particular customer segment. The application generates the corresponding portfolio using a
            ML model that segments customers base on age, income, marital status and many other factors, predicts
            stock price and calculate volatility of a particular stock. Each stock is then given a volatility score
            and based on the calculated risk aversion score for each segment the portfolios are suggested to the users.
        <h3><b>SPORTS CLUB WEB APPLICATION</b></h3>
            Developed a user-friendly
            web application using python and django web framework. Provides user functionalities like
            registering in club, becoming a member in the club, registration and payment for facilities, 
            events and tournaments. Users can choose the time-slots in which they want to enroll for a 
            particular facility. Users will be reminded of events and tournaments organized by the club.
            Also developed chat functionality where users can chat and share memories with different members
            of the club.
